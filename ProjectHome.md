&lt;hr&gt;


_"Secure E-Mail with simplicity..."_
<br>
<h2>What's this...?</h2>

Billions of emails are sent every day, but a minuscule fraction of them are encrypted, possibly due to the complexity of existing email encryption systems.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>This new encryption proposal would make it easier for people to send private emails without the need to manage complicated public keys like in existing proposals such as PGP and S/MIME.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In this project, we have developed a prototype implementation for a new email encryption proposal as a Microsoft Outlook add-in.</blockquote>


<h2>Features</h2>


The ECube-v1.0 implements the "Quick Security" feature of the proposal, which allows the user to send and read Password Encrypted Emails.<br>
<br>
ECube provides a simple and user friendly GUI. Sending and Reading encrypted emails is as easy as completing the following dialog boxes.<br>
<br>

<ul><li><h3>Decryption</h3></li></ul>

<ul><li>ECube-v1.0 is currently available for Windows platform (for Outlook version 2007 & 2010). The recent version of the software can be downloaded from the <a href='https://code.google.com/p/easier-email-encryption/wiki/Downloads'>Downloads page</a>.</li></ul>

<ul><li>This prototype implementation has been made using .NET Framework 4.0 in VB.NET.</li></ul>

<i><i>NOTE:</i>Bouncy Castle<b>.NET library was used for all the Cryptographic functions.</b></i>
